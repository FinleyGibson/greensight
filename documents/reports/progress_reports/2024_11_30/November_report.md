# November Report

## Summary
- No significant correlation found for basic bands.
- Also ppscores of 0. Means does not improve on a "naive baseline". 
- Data not as bad as I had thought: fixed some things and now it works mostly.
- Tried to get non-averaged data to check greenbelts. 
    - From Milto's code: not returned using the API calls implemented.
    - Tried myself: Slightly worrying returns from Google Earth Engine- could explain offset. 
- "Fixed" offset: still an issue. Offset is greater than N mothsn
    - could be due to bands always being negative (inverse correlation).
    - could be due to observations getting GEE data myself. 
- All indices are implemented and ready to go. Need to coordinate with Milto about running them. 
- Repeat entries in data I have which are not the same. 



## Band correlation  

### Sentinel-One

### Sentinel-Two

## Data
1. Missing data not such an issues. 
2. Duplicate entries which are non-identical.
