## Current issues:
1. empty .csv files, this seems to happen whether I get within limits or not, for certain years (2015, 2016)
2. successful data has inconsistent columns. 
    - Shape: shape_id x product(month, index)
    - inconsistency in rows: months are missing
    - _some_ indics missing for months where we do have them.
