## Project goal:

 Carbon Paper: Finding associations between carbon estimated from JULES and existing indices from EO data.



## Questions:

"PlotToSat can currently read shapefiles, but it produces one time-series (instead of a time-series associated with each polygon)", 

1. Why the need for processing multiple polygons? Is this so that you can request JULES "pixels" as polygons? 

2. "... we can create the indices"

3. Success criteria?  

4. Do I ever need to actually run PlotToStat? 

5. Have we settled on a subset yet? 

6. Do we need to compute the indices? Or are they publicly available?



## Data:

1. ULES outputs - mean and std for polygon at daily intervals.  

2. indices available [here](https://step.esa.int/main/wp-content/help/versions/10.0.0/snap-toolboxes/eu.esa.opt.opttbx.radiometric.indices.ui/OperatorsIndexList.html)

3. 



## outputs:

- Time series for each index. 

- Which indices provide the best match to JULES (Vegetation and carbon)? 

- Correlation analysis.

- Monthly timesteps
